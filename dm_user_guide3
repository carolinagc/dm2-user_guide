**Preface

Since user guides tend to be boring to write and then boring to read, we've tried to have fun writing this one and hopefully you'll have also fun reading it, in between you'll discover how Deepamehta works!


**Introduction



** The situation
If we think DM as a whole of situations, then the best way to start would be to create a first situation.
Let's imagine we've got an appointment with some friends to talk about a possible business, normally you would take somewhow structure notes, with some side notations that come up later.
So the notes taken look like this:

Marina(Barcelona) is doing a project with the neighbourhood organization AAVVB
Participants: Marina, the group XXX from the University UOA, Pep and Rosa
The goal: Map the changes in the neighborhood in the last decades
How: Going for a walk around the neighborhood with old people
At the end of the walk photos will be taken and uploaded and associated to their location in a map on the website
Maybe there is a possibility to create a collaborative project with a neighborhood in Berlin
The project will last for one year

Let's go to our browser, just to dive better in DM, a suggestion is to set your browser to full screen, so you enter in DM mode ;-)
The first thing you will see is:
  The screen is divided in three parts, 
    a toolbar at the top, 
    a left panel that is called Topicmap
    a right panel that is called Detail Panel and shows the details about the item currently selected
    
The toolbar in the top part allows you to select and perform various operations. If you are not logged in,  you will be able to select a Workspace, a Topicmap, to search by name an item that you know or by type, access the help and the link to log in. when you log in, you will also see a Create menu.

If you take a look at what there is in the Create menu, you will see that by default it appears "Person", "Institution", "Notes", "Web Resource" ..mmm actually probably for the moment that is enough to write down our notes from the meeting in a DM way.

Let's proceed

We can create 3 Persons, Marina, Pep and Rosa

[dm2_example01.png]

[dm2_example02.png]

We can create 2 Institutions, AAVVB, University UOA

[dm2_example04.png]

We can create a note with the name of the group from the University

[dm2_example05.png]


Now that we have the main elements on our left panel, the Topicmap, let's see what are the relations between them.

Until now, we have drawn 3 Persons, 2 Institutions, 1 Note which in DM language would be  6 Topics
Now we want to establish the relations between the Topics, and in DM language the relations are called associations.

Marina, Pep and Rosa work together, so we could say that Marina works with Rosa and Marina works with Pep, and in the same way could we do with Rosa and Pep.
If you right click on Marina, a menu will display and you will see the "Associate" option, click on it.

[dm2_example06.png]

 A line will appear, drag it to Rosa so an association is created. So now Marina is associated with Rosa.
 
 [dm2_example07.png]

We repeat the same process to create the Relation between Marina and Pep, and Rosa and Pep. Now the three of them are connected.

[dm2_example08.png]

Another cool thing we can do, is to name the association, because associations are also editable, let's do it in a descriptive way, and write "works with".
 
 [dm2_example09.png]

You can edit each of the other associations, to also name it.

*Tip*
If you double click on the association it will become editable

Now let's create the associations between the Group of researchers and Marina, Pep and Rosa

 [dm2_example10.png]

But we know that the Group of researchers belong to the UOA University, so we can also establish the association between them, and name it, for example, isParOf, since the Group of researchers is part of the University.

 [dm2_example12.png]

So, if we click on the Note "Group of researchers", on the Detail Panel we can see on top we have a block of information that is the  Name and the Description of the Note, below we can see that the Note is associated with other topics in the DM world.
In our case this Note is associated to one Institution, three Person. Then  it comes the Topic Type which defines the structure of the "thing", in our case the Note, as a topic is a generic idea, when we add the "type" we are defining exactly what it is, normally by setting a group of properties, in the case of Note these are "Name" and "Text". Just after we can see the name of the Topicmap to which our Note belongs to and finally the Worspace. Workspace would be like the topmost container for our content, let's say we could have one Workspace per situation.

 [dm2_example11.png]


No need to retain all this information, is just a first introduction to the information that appears in the Detail Panel, so let's do a break, get a cup of tea and back in a few minutes

Tea time!!!

Feeling better now, right? Ok, next thing we want to create is the project, how is related to the people and the web resource where we can find more information.

Probably you main area in the left panel is quite full, but if you click on it and drag it, it will move :)

*Tip*
  If you want to move the canvas, so that you can see better the topic map, you just have to click on the canvas and drag it untill you locate the topic map where you want.
  You can resize the Panels. You just need to put the mouse on the border between the two panels and when appears (put here the icon) just drag the panel to the size you want.

Once we've situated the canvas, we create another Note. We call it "Tornaralloc"
 [dm2_example13.png]
 
Next we associate it to Marina, we wil call the association "An idea of"

  [dm2_example16.png]
 
 Next go to the Create menu in the toolbar and select Web resource, and we write the URL of the project

 [dm2_example17.png]

Now we have a webresource associated to the project

[Suggestions] On the create menu, everytime you create a new Topic map, just see the default Topic Types. And on the Topic Types that the user creates add the option "show on create menu"
