**Preface

Since user guides tend to be boring to write and then boring to read, we've tried to have fun writing this one and hopefully you'll have also fun reading it, in between you'll discover how Deepamehta works!


**Introduction



** The situation
If we think DM as a whole of situations, then the best way to start would be to create a first situation.
Let's imagine we've got an appointment with some friends to talk about a possible business, normally you would take somewhow structure notes, with some side notations that come up later.
So the notes taken look like this:

Marina(Barcelona) is doing a project with the neighbourhood organization AAVVB
Participants: Marina, the group XXX from the University UOA, Pep and Rosa
The goal: Map the changes in the neighborhood in the last decades
How: Going for a walk around the neighborhood with old people
At the end of the walk photos will be taken and uploaded and associated to their location in a map on the website
Maybe there is a possibility to create a collaborative project with a neighborhood in Berlin
The project will last for one year

Let's go to our browser, just to dive better in DM, a suggestion is to set your browser to full screen, so you enter in DM mode ;-)
The first thing you will see is:
  The screen is divided in three parts, 
    a toolbar at the top, 
    a left panel that is called Topicmap
    a right panel that is called Detail Panel
    
The toolbar in the top part allows you to select and perform various operations. If you are not logged in,  you will be able to select a Workspace, a Topicmap, to search by name an item that you know or by type, access the help and the link to log in. when you log in, you will also see a Create menu.

If you take a look at what there is in the Create menu, you will see that by default it appears "Person", "Institution", "Notes", "Web Resource" ..mmm actually probably for the moment that is enough to write down our notes from the meeting in a DM way.

Let's proceed

We can create 3 Persons, Marina, Pep and Rosa

We can create 2 Institutions, AAVVB, University UOA

[dm2_example04.png]

We can create a note with the name of the group from the University

[dm2_example05.png]


Now that we have the main elements on our left panel, the Topicmap, let's see what are the relations between them.

Until now, we have drawn 3 Persons, 2 Institutions, 1 Note which in DM language would be  6 Topics
Now we want to establish the relations between the Topics, and in DM language the relations are called associations.

Marina, Pep and Rosa work together, so we could say that Marina works with Rosa and Marina works with Pep, and in the same way could we do with Rosa and Pep.
If you right click on Marina, a menu will display and you will see the "Associate" option, click on it.

[dm2_example06.png]

 A line will appear, drag it to Rosa so an association is created. So now Marina is associated with Rosa.
 
 [dm2_example07.png]

We repeat the same process to create the Relation between Marina and Pep, and Rosa and Pep. Now the three of them are connected.

[dm2_example08.png]

Another cool thing we can do, is to name the association, because associations are also editable, let's do it in a descriptive way, and write "works with".
 
 [dm2_example09.png]

You can edit each of the other associations, to also name it.

*Tip*
If you double click on the association it will become editable

Now let's create the associations between the Group of researchers and Marina, Pep and Rosa

 [dm2_example10.png]

But we know that the Group of researchers belong to the UOA University, so we can also establish the association between them, and name it, for example, isParOf, since the Group of researchers is part of the University.

So, what we've got now is the group of people that is going to participate in the project.  






[Suggestions] On the create menu, everytime you create a new Topic map, just see the default Topic Types. And on the Topic Types that the user creates add the option "show on create menu"
